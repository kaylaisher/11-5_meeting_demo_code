# 11-5_meeting_demo_code

## Room for improvement
- bridging fault detection algotithm
- SAF point out location
- fault injection style simulator pending time increase as block size increase, maybe figure out other simulation method

## Future work
 - Make a module
 - One circuit engine include fault insertion logic
 - One configuration file
 - A couple of algorithms to plug and play
 - flexible bit size
 - Fault coverage scaling
